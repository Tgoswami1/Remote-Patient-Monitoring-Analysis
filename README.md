# Remote-Patient-Monitoring-Analysis

**Practical Task: Product Metrics & Analysis for a Remote Patient Monitoring Feature Task Overview: You are a Product Analyst at our telehealth startup, and we are planning to launch a new feature that enables remote patient monitoring (RPM). 
This feature allows patients to share real-time health data (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, glucose levels) with their healthcare providers through wearable devices. As a Product Analyst, your role is to identify key metrics, analyze user behavior, and provide actionable insights to ensure the success of this feature. 

Task Instructions: Feature Analysis: 

Define 3-5 key business and product metrics that should be tracked to measure the success of this RPM feature. Justify why each metric is important. Describe a possible user journey for this feature, from the moment a patient starts using a wearable device for RPM to when the healthcare provider reviews their data. Identify 2-3 points in this journey where user engagement should be monitored.

Problem Breakdown: Initial user feedback suggests that patients find it challenging to set up the wearable device and that data syncing with the app is inconsistent. Break down this ambiguous problem into 2-3 smaller, specific problems that you would address as a Product Analyst. Propose one hypothesis for each of the smaller problems and outline how you would validate these hypotheses with data. 

Data Analysis: Imagine you have access to user engagement data for the past 3 months. The data includes the number of active users, frequency of data syncs, user drop-off rates during the setup process, and feedback scores. Using this data, outline the steps you would take to analyze the drop-off rates during the setup process and determine the factors contributing to them. Suggest an experiment you would design with the Product Manager to improve the setup experience of the RPM feature. Describe the experimentâ€™s objective, control and variant groups, and the metrics you would monitor. 

Reporting & Insights: Create a mock report or dashboard (using a tool like Excel, Google Sheets, or a mock-up tool) that showcases how you would present key insights and findings from the data analysis to stakeholders. Include at least 3 key insights or recommendations based on the data analysis that you would present to the product team to help improve the feature. Expected Outcome: A detailed document with the analysis, problem breakdown, and recommendations. A mock dashboard or report with visualizations of key metrics (charts, tables, etc.). A brief presentation (5-10 minutes) explaining your approach and findings.****
